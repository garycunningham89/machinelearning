# Machine Learning and Statistics
### Tasks 2020
### Due: last commit on or before December 18th, 2020
Four tasks will included in Jupyter Notebook. Tasks Descriptor listed below:

### Task 1
##### Task: Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. 
###### Notes: The modules and packages that come as standard with Python cannot be used. 
###### Include research, references and a description of your algorithm.
#### Observations and  Limitations:

### Task 2
#####  Task: The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. Use the table in Wikipedia article on Chi-Squared test as an example and validate the outputs stated.
###### Notes: Use scipy.stats to verify the value give in the test and calculate the associated p value.
###### Include references, research and justify your analysis. 
#### Observations and  Limitations:

### Task 3
##### Compare the Microsoft Excel standard deviation functions: STDEV.P and STDEV.S and perform an evaluation the better estimate for standard deviation of a sample of a populate using NumPy package.
###### Note: Research and explain standard deviation, the Excel functions and the differences between them in terms of accuracy of calculation.
###### Use research and NumPy to perform a simulation demonstrating any findings. 
#### Observations and  Limitations:

#### Marking scheme
The following marking scheme will be used to mark your submission out of 100%:
25% Research:
Evidence of research performed on topic; submission based on referenced literature, particularly academic literature; evidence of understanding of the documentation for any software
or libraries used.
25% Development:
Environment can be set up as described; code works without tweaking and as described; code is efficient, clean, and clear; evidence of consideration of standards and conventions appropriate to code of this kind.
25% Consistency:
Evidence of planning and project management; pragmatic attitude to work as evidenced by well-considered commit history; commits are of a reasonable size; consideration of how commit history will be perceived by others.
25% Documentation:
Clear documentation of how to create an environment in which any code will run, how to prepare the code for running, how to run the code including setting any options or flags, and what to expect upon running the code. Concise descriptions of code in comments and README.
