# Machine Learning and Statistics
### Tasks 2020
### Due: last commit on or before December 18th, 2020
Four tasks will included in Jupyter Notebook. Tasks Descriptor listed below:

### Task 1
##### Task: Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. 
###### Notes: The modules and packages that come as standard with Python cannot be used. 
###### Include research, references and a description of your algorithm.
#### Observations and  Limitations:

### Task 2
#####  Task: The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. Use the table in Wikipedia article on Chi-Squared test as an example and validate the outputs stated.
###### Notes: Use scipy.stats to verify the value give in the test and calculate the associated p value.
###### Include references, research and justify your analysis. 
#### Observations and  Limitations:

### Task 3
##### Compare the Microsoft Excel standard deviation functions: STDEV.P and STDEV.S and perform an evaluation the better estimate for standard deviation of a sample of a populate using NumPy package.
###### Note: Research and explain standard deviation, the Excel functions and the differences between them in terms of accuracy of calculation.
###### Use research and NumPy to perform a simulation demonstrating any findings. 
#### Observations and  Limitations:

### Task 4
##### November 30th, 2020: Use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisher’s famous Iris data set. You will easily obtain a copy of the data set online. Explain in a Markdown cell how your code works and how accurate it might be, and then explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species of iris
###### Note: Research, apply and assess scikit k-means clustering on Fisher's Data Set to see if it can help predict the species types of the Iris within the data set.
###### Use research and scikit k-means clustering to perform a simulation demonstrating any findings. 
#### Observations and  Limitations:


INTRODUCTION Ronald Aylmer Fisher's Iris data set has been consulted in a vast range of articles and disciplines as noticeable during initial research. Ronald Fisher, himself, was an English statistician firstly, with intrinsic ties to the studies of genetics, eugenics and biology as a whole who compiled the Iris Data Set as per this study (Yates and Mather, 1963). His studies have given him the affectionate title of "Father of Statistics" by some and he believed his various studies allowed greater ties between mathematics and biology as statistics, especially, are useful while trying to explain the various phenomena of science (Yates and Mather, 1963). His own 1936 study titled "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" portrayed data on three different Iris flower species;- Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. The data compiled comprised of four features of each species, i.e. sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The total flowers contained in the data set were 150, split into 50 of each of the three species. All of the attribute information was measured in cm. The data set characteristics are summarized in the following list (Fisher, 1936, adapted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, Iris data set):

Classes: 3 - Species - Setosa, Virginica, Veriscolor.
No of Inputs: 150 - 50 of each class above.
Number of Attributes: 4 - Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width.
Attribute Measurement: cm.
Analysis Type: Multivariate
The multivariate analysis type utilized by Fisher allows a range of measurement techniques on this data set as there are more than one variable and those variables are correlated (Olkin and Sampson, 2001). The intention of this project is to firstly, upload the data set, compile various calculations (using the Python programming language) of various variables within the data set and summarize the results with the aid of statistics, tables and diagrams, where required, to attempt to explain its usefulness and its ties to machine learning and data analysis overall.

#### Marking scheme
The following marking scheme will be used to mark your submission out of 100%:
25% Research:
Evidence of research performed on topic; submission based on referenced literature, particularly academic literature; evidence of understanding of the documentation for any software
or libraries used.
25% Development:
Environment can be set up as described; code works without tweaking and as described; code is efficient, clean, and clear; evidence of consideration of standards and conventions appropriate to code of this kind.
25% Consistency:
Evidence of planning and project management; pragmatic attitude to work as evidenced by well-considered commit history; commits are of a reasonable size; consideration of how commit history will be perceived by others.
25% Documentation:
Clear documentation of how to create an environment in which any code will run, how to prepare the code for running, how to run the code including setting any options or flags, and what to expect upon running the code. Concise descriptions of code in comments and README.
