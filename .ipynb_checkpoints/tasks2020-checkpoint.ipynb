    "###### The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example [4], stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use scipy.stats to verify this value and calculate the associated p value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi-squared test (or a χ2 test) is a statistical hypothesis test that compares the relationship between categorical variables, mainly determining the depedence between the variables (either independent or related) (Kent State University, 2020). The test is nonparametric in that it  does not conform to \"prescribed models that are determined by a small number of parameters\" (Investopedia, 2020). The test is valid when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis, that determines there is no difference between certain characteristics of a dataset (Investopedia, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "The chi-squared test utilizes a contingency table ( or a cross-tabulation/crosstab/two-way table) and all of the data is classified to categorical variables, one varible are in the rows, and the categories of the other appear in columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the Kent study, for an accurate chi test, data must meet the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two or more categories (groups) for each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Independence of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There is no relationship between the subjects in each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The categorical variables are not \"paired\" in any way (e.g. pre-test/post-test observations).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Relatively large sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Expected frequencies for each cell are at least 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Expected frequencies should be at least 5 for the majority (80%) of the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for a chi squared test adapted in this notebook from Kent States study is:\n",
    "$$ X^2c=\\sum_{}^\\ \\frac{(Oi-Ei)}{E^i}^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the data is outlined below: c = Degrees of freedom, O = Observed value(s), E = Expected value(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Squared test calculates the expected frequency of observations for each categorical vairbale and determines the division of the groups within (or the observed frequencies), matches the expected. The output of the test analyses the relationships between the assumption or null hypothesis and the expected frequencies and the variables are considered independent if the frequencies are similar and not dependent if not similar (Brownlee, 2020).\n",

The sample of 650 residents of the city is taken and their occupations are divided depending on the status: \"white collar\", \"blue collar\", or \"no collar\".

    "# Task 3: STDEV.P vs STDEV.S - The excel functions.\n",
    "### November 16th: The standard deviation of an array of numbers x is calculated using numpy as np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)/len(x)) . However, Microsoft Excel has two different versions of the standard deviation calculation, STDEV.P and STDEV.S .The STDEV.P function performs the above calculation but in the STDEV.S calculation the division is by len(x)-1 rather than len(x) . Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard deviation value is the value that a data set spans or deviates from the mean of the data set. The mean of course being the average of the sum of the data in the data set. A standard deviation value is either lower or higher depicting a value either closer or farther away from the mean, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Microsoft Excel: STDEV.P vs STDEV.S\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation calculation has preloaded functions on Microsoft Excel, and there are 6 standard functions in total. Each function has different functionality in terms of calculation but the general split is based on whether the calculation is on a sample or on the entire population. \n",
    "\n",
    "A population sample standard deviation can be used to infer for the entire population and to account for this inference the calculations of these standard deviations are different. The STEV.S and STDEV.P excel functions are strictly numerical calculations and do not account logical or text values (Microsoft, 2020). \n",
    "The difference between the STEV.S and STDEV.P is based on the method. The standard deviation for STDEV.S is calculated using the \"n\" method and the STEV.P is \"n-1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for STDEV.S is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x-x^-)}{n - 1}^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for STDEV.P is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x-x^-)}{n}^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "X = sample mean AVERAGE(number1,number2..) and n is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numpy STDEV\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated: \"The standard deviation of an array of numbers x is calculated using numpy as:\n",
    "$$ np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)/len(x))\" $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The len(x) in this calculation matches the n method as seen in the STDEV.P excel calculation as it accounts for the entire population. Thus len(x-1) would match the STDEV.S function."
